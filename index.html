					<p>Way back in 1995 my parents plugged a phone line into our family computer and my love of the internet was born. Within a year I was writing simple HTML webpages and populating them with some of the most horrid bump mapped backgrounds Netscape ever displayed.</p>
					<BR>
					<p>Many years later I completed a degree in Commercial Graphics from Pittsburg State University, picking up some desktop publishing experience along the way. After a quick internship building websites for a cement manufacturing company, I ended up in the printing trade, helping build automated image balancing workflows and preflighting publications for press. My career progressed along this path into customer service and sales, culminating in my current customer service managment role for a printing company.</p>
					<br>
					<p>While printing claimed the first decade of my career, personal side projects from blogs to web comics allowed me to periodically dip a toe back in the front end side of web development. I recently made the decision to do a full fledged cannonball back into the pool, and am currently taking part in a full-stack development boot camp (of which this very website is homework assignment #1)</p>
					<br>
					<p>Stay tuned for future developments (no pun intended). I have a feeling this place is going to see a lot of changes in very short order.</p>
